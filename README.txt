I did the program in pycharm and to start the code correctly you need to change the address in glob to the address of data set and to test other panos you need to change the pano name.
#TO LOOK FOR DIFFERENT PANORAMAS YOU NEED TO CHANGE HERE!!
ori = glob(".\HW2_Dataset\pano2" + "/*.png")         #this is the addresses of the pano files you may need to change this part
 output is 2 imshows and I showed the homography matrix in the print part.
